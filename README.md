# Pig-Game
Its a 2 player Game with rolling dice. 
First player will roll the dice. Now he has 2 options either hold the score or roll dice agan.
1. If he holds the dice score , second player can roll the dice now(second player chance comes).
2. If he choose to roll dice again. He shouldn't receive dice score as 1 because it will make his
   current score to 0.
   Other than dice score 1, all other dice score will be added to his current score and if he hits
   hold button to his final score.
